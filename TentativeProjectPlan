1. Do the basic exploration of dataset either by using python or by reading dataset documentation.
   - get dimensions of the dataset 
   - get idea about the structure and type of variables
2. Do the feature selection to reduce the number of variables for EDA.
   - Using one hot encoding for converting categorical variables into numeric arrays suitable for input to sklearn feature selection methods.
3. Do EDA of variables selected.
   - scatter plot for continous variables vs price
   - box plot or density plot for categorical variables vs. price
4. Partitioning of data into training and test data.
5. Model selection.
  - assuming linear relationship between predictors and response
  - all models of linear regression 
6. Model validation.
7. Test run.
8. Deployment.
