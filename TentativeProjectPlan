1. Do the basic exploration of dataset either by using python or by reading dataset documentation.
   - [x] get dimensions of the dataset 
   - [x] get idea about the structure and type of variables
2. Do the data preprocessing 
   - [x] Imputing of missing variables if any.
   - [x] Hot encoding of categorical variables.
3. Do the feature selection to reduce the number of variables for EDA.
   - [x] input to sklearn feature selection methods.
4. Do EDA of variables selected.
   - [] scatter plot for continous variables vs price
   - [] box plot or density plot for categorical variables vs. price
5. Partitioning of data into training and test data.
6. Model selection.
  - assuming linear relationship between predictors and response
  - [] Multiple linear regression
  - [] MLR with backward regression
  - [] Polynomial regression
7. Model validation.
8. Test run.
9. Deployment.
