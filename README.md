# ML-AmesHousePricePrediction
### Why have I done this project?
The project is done to show my proficiency in regression modelling. I did Python and Machine Learning course on Kaggle and that has been inspiration for this project.<br> </br>
### What is this project?
#### This regression modelling project shows proficiency in doing preliminary data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model creation, model selection and model optimization. 
### How the Project has been done?  
1. I used Ames housing dataset available in csv format on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ames-housing-data/data). 
2. I started by doing the [preprocessing](Preprocessing.ipynb) of the data.
3. I have followed it with [exploratory data analysis](Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb).
4. Finally, I created the [model](Modelling&Evaluation.ipynb) and evaluated it. <br></br>
### What software do you need to run this project on your terminal?
I have used Jupyter Noteboook through Anaconda distribution. Any distribution that can run Jupyter Notebook can be used.<br></br>
