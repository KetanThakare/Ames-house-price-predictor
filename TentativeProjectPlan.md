1. Do the basic exploration of dataset either by using python or by reading dataset documentation.
   - [x] get dimensions of the dataset 
   - [x] get idea about the structure and type of variables

2. Do the data preprocessing 
   - [x] Imputing of missing variables if any.
   - [x] Hot encoding of categorical variables.

3. Do the feature selection to reduce the number of variables for EDA.
   - [x] input to sklearn feature selection methods.

4. Do EDA of variables selected.
   - [ ] scatter plot for continous variables vs price
   - [ ] box plot or density plot for categorical variables vs. price

5. Partitioning of data into training and test data.

6. Modelling and Evaluation
   - [x] Multiple linear regression
   - [x] Ridge Regression
   - [x] Lasso Regression
   - [x] Elastic Net
   
7. Seek alternative model Eg. SVM,RandomForest etc if results of Regression modelss are not satisfactory. 

8. Model validation.

9. Test run.

10. Deployment.
